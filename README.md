# Bad Parser Generator
I got curious about Python's ASDL after looking into AST for my own programming languages so here I go reinventing the wheel again.

This will probably be a very unclean project but it's worth a shot for learning.

# The Goal
The goal is to mix together elements of yacc and ASDL to try to generate a flimsy parser in Python.
