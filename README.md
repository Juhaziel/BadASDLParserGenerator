# Bad ASDL Parser Generator
I got curious about Python's ASDL after looking into AST for my own programming languages so here I go reinventing the wheel again.

This will probably be a very unclean project but it's worth a shot for learning.

# The Goal
After looking a parser generation I got scared so now it's just a bad ASDL parser that generates AST node classes in Python and I'll write the parser manually again
